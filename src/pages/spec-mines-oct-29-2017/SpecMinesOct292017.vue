                The morning of October 29th, 2017, I was intending to have balls. I was <i>indending</i> to just say "I'm doin it." However, I woke up that morning, to a pouring rain in a cutting 40Â° with 30mph winds. The colloquial, <i>It</i> I am referring to is Rowdy Dog, in Blacksburg Virginia, the last of the XXC races for the season.
