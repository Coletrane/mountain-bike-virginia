      The entry fee for the <a :href="$store.getters.posts('rockstar-va-2018').fbEvent">RockStar VA</a> race/ride
      captures the spirit of backcountry riding exquisitely. Entrants can either donate to a trail work advocacy group,
      or complete 10 hours of trail work. Seeing as the latter involves me out exploring and riding, the trail work
      option was the only choice.
