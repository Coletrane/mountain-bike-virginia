  "promo": "A Mountain Bike Triple Feature! Wrangle the 3rd annual Creature from Carvins Cove Cross Country and XXC Marathon Mountain Bike Races, and the FIRST EVER ENDURO at Carvins Cove. Carvins Cove is the second largest city park in the United States and sports over 60 miles of trails. The XC course is a spritley 15 miles through some beatuiful lakeside trails. The XXC course is a tough 44 miles that will duplicate no singletrack, and take you to the top of Brushy Mountain <i>twice</i> before ascending onto the legendary Rattlin' Run! The Enduro course will be announced the day of the event, but I'm sure the locals have some great guesses.",
