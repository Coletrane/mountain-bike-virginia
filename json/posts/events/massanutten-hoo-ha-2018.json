    "Came Hell or high water (the latter delivered in tidal waves),  the 30th Massanutten Hoo-Ha! is in the books.",
  "description":
    "Dateline Keezletown, VA, 1989. An ambitious ski manager early adopts the mountain bike thing and throws a whimsically titled event on a lark, complete with equally whimsical log pull and lake jump contests. Though the lake jump and log pull have been left by the trailside, the Hoo-Ha! continued the next 29 years with Kenny Hess still at the helm of one of the most enduring events in mountain bike racing, with a bright forecast for years to come.",
